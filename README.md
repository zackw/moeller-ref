This is a reference implementation of the key encapsulation mechanism
from [Bodo MÃ¶ller][0]'s paper "[A Public-Key Encryption Scheme with Pseudo-
Random Ciphertexts][1]" ([ESORICS 2004][2]).  To the best
of my knowledge this cryptosystem has never been implemented before.
I have implemented *only* the key encapsulation mechanism, not the
full hybrid cryptosystem.  There are other slight deviations from the
paper; see comments in the header files.

There are actually two reference implementations, based on different
libraries.  The `-c` files use [Crypto++][3] and the `-o` files use
[OpenSSL][4].  `make check` tests them against each other.

hereby waive all copyright and related or neighboring rights to
this reference implementation.
