This is a reference implementation of the key encapsulation mechanism
from Bodo MÃ¶ller's paper "A Public-Key Encryption Scheme with Pseudo-
Random Ciphertexts" (ESORICS 2004),
<http://www.bmoeller.de/pdf/pke-pseudo-esorics2004.pdf>.  To the best
of my knowledge this cryptosystem has never been implemented before.
I have implemented *only* the key encapsulation mechanism, not the
full hybrid cryptosystem.  There are other slight deviations from the
paper; see comments in the header files.

There are actually two reference implementations, based on different
libraries.  The -c files use Crypto++ <http://www.cryptopp.com/> and
the -o files use OpenSSL <http://www.openssl.org/>.  They are tested
against each other by 'make check'.

To the extent possible under law, I, Zachary Weinberg, do hereby waive
all copyright and related or neighboring rights to this reference
implementation. <http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/>
