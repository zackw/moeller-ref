This is a reference implementation of the key encapsulation mechanism
from Bodo MÃ¶ller's paper "A Public-Key Encryption Scheme with Pseudo-
Random Ciphertexts" (ESORICS 2004),
<http://www.bmoeller.de/pdf/pke-pseudo-esorics2004.pdf>.  To the best
of my knowledge this cryptosystem has never been implemented before.
I have implemented *only* the key encapsulation mechanism, not the
full hybrid cryptosystem.  There are other slight deviations from the
paper; see comments in the header files.

The reference implementation currently makes use of Crypto++:

A second implementation using OpenSSL is planned for the near future.
